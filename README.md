# Animal-that-implements-Runnable-Interface 
is source code that allows a concurrent exectuion in a seperate thread. In this code we have a race where two animals rest and move forward, and the winning animal gets to eat at the end. The race ends when any animals reaches a distance of 120. 

AnimalRaceApp is the main class and creates instance of "Food" and "Animal" and starts two threads that simulate a race between a hare and a tortoise.
